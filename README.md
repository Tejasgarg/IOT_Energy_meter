# IOT_Energy_meter
An IoT-based Smart Electricity Energy Meter using ESP32 Microprocessor and Blynk Application

Traditional electricity consumption monitoring is often manual, time-consuming, and lacks real-time insights. With IoT integration, we have built a smart energy meter that automates electricity tracking, provides remote accessibility, and retains critical data even during power outages.

Working :
Using the SCT-013 current sensor and ZMPT101B voltage sensor, our system accurately measures voltage, current, power, and total energy consumption (kWh). The ESP32 microcontroller processes this data and transmits it to Blynk application for remote monitoring.

Key Features:
* For seamless communication, multiple protocols are integrated: Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), TCP/IP, I2C, EEPROM, UART
* Real-time monitoring with ESP32 and Blynk 2.0
* Remote access via web and mobile dashboard
* Power outage data retention using EEPROM
* Local display using I2C for LCD
* Debugging and serial communication through UART
* Secure data transmission using TCP/IP
* Cost-effective and scalable solution for energy management

Integrating IoT into energy tracking brings us closer to smarter, data-driven electricity consumption, with great potential for optimizing energy use in homes, offices, societies, and condominiums.
